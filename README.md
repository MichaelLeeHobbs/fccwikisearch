Objective: Build a CodePen.io that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://codepen.io/GeoffStorbeck/full/MwgQea.

Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.

Rule #3: Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.

Here are the user stories you must enable, and optional bonus user stories:

User Story: As a user, I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

Bonus User Story:As a user, I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

Bonus User Story:As a user, when I type in the search box, I can see a dropdown menu with autocomplete options for matching Wikipedia entries.

Hint: Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.

Remember to use RSAP if you get stuck. Try using jQuery's $.getJSON()â€‰to consume APIs.

When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen. If you pair programmed, you should also include the Free Code Camp username of your pair.

If you'd like immediate feedback on your project, click this button and paste in a link to your CodePen project. Otherwise, we'll review it before you start your nonprofit projects.
